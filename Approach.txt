Approach - 

1. Imputed the null values - For Credit_Product, I put dummy values 'Unknown'.

2. Performed label encoding for categorical variables.

3. Ran two CatBoost Classifier Model, with following hyper-parameters: scale_pos_weight = 3.215, iterations=500, learning_rate=0.1 and depth = 4/6
In these models, I passed the indices of Categorical columns so that the model can internally handle it.
Third model is a XGBoost Classfier with following hyper-parameters: n_estimators=500,n_jobs = -1,max_depth=6,learning_rate=0.1

4. Final results were calculated as an ensemble(simple averaging) of these three models.
